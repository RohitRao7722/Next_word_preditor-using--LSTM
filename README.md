###Next Word Predictor using LSTM
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for next-word prediction. By training on a sequence of words, the model learns the likelihood of subsequent words, enabling it to predict the next word in a sequence accurately.

##Features
Deep Learning with LSTM: Utilizes an LSTM neural network to model sequential dependencies in text.
Text Generation: Predicts the next word in a sentence or phrase based on learned patterns.
Customizable Training Data: Can be trained on various text sources for specific use cases (e.g., formal text, casual conversation).

#Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/RohitRao7722/Next_word_preditor-using--LSTM.git
cd Next_word_preditor-using--LSTM
#Install dependencies
This project requires Python and several libraries. Install them using:

bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas

##Usage
To run the next-word predictor, open the Jupyter notebook file next_word_predictor.ipynb and execute the cells in order. This will train the model (if not already trained) and allow you to input text for prediction.
